# Genetic-optimized Quantum Embeddings

This repository contains the results shown in the Extended Abstract
*"Genetic Algorithms can automatize the design of Quantum Embeddings"*
under submission for QTML'22 and code to reproduce them.

The results are shown in `genetic-algorithm-results` directory while 
the code can be run using `python3.9 paper-experiment.py`. The code 
is based on QuASK library.

## QuASK - Quantum Advantage Seeker with Kernel

QuASK is a quantum machine learning software written in Python that 
supports researchers in designing, experimenting, and assessing 
different quantum and classic kernels performance. This software 
is package agnostic and can be integrated with all major quantum 
software packages (e.g. IBM Qiskit, Xanaduâ€™s Pennylane, Amazon Braket).

QuASK guides the user through a simple preprocessing of input data, 
definition and calculation of quantum and classic kernels, 
either custom or pre-defined ones. From this evaluation the package 
provide an assessment about potential quantum advantage and prediction 
bounds on generalization error.

Beyond theoretical framing, it allows for the generation of parametric
quantum kernels that can be trained using gradient-descent-based 
optimization, grid search, or genetic algorithms. Projected quantum 
kernels, an effective solution to mitigate the curse of dimensionality 
induced by the exponential scaling dimension of large Hilbert spaces,
is also calculated. QuASK can also generate the observable values of
a quantum model and use them to study the prediction capabilities of
the quantum and classical kernels.

The initial release is accompanied by the journal article ["QuASK - Quantum
Advantage Seeker with Kernels" available on arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.15284).
